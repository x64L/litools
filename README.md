# LITOOLS - Make Linux installations slightly easier!
Two scripts that make the Linux installation process easier for me, straight out of Arch's live USB image.  
**autochroot** - Chroot into a new system easily, without having to mount pseudo-filesystems!  
**genfstab** - Generating fstab files has never been easier!  

# Getting the scripts in a shell
## curl
**autochroot** - "curl -L https://bit.ly/2H0JsDc > autochroot"  
**genfstab** - "curl -L https://bit.ly/2pUIRe7 > genfstab"
## wget
**autochroot** - "wget https://bit.ly/2H0JsDc"  
**genfstab** - "curl https://bit.ly/2pUIRe7"
